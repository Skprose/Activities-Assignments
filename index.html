          <p class = "abouttext">I am Sangeetha. I am a home maker and have 2 beautifull kids. My son is 14 years old.
          My daughter is 10 years old. My husband is also in the IT Industry and travels a lot.
          My exposure to computers started during high school where I took courses in computer science.
          I also did a Diploma Course in Computers when I did my graduation in Commerce. Later I
          obtained Master of Computer Applications, University of Madras.</p>
          <br />
          <p class = "abouttext">Later I joined L&amp;T a major Construction Company. I was Overwhelmed when
          my first Project in Oracle Pl/SQL, Oracle Forms - went Live.
          Later in USA, I worked with Sematic Consulting Services, CA. I got busy with
          my kids as my husband was travelling a lot but did not feel to keep myself away from Computers.
          Mean while I earned Oracle PL/SQL Associate Certificate and later I also
          did some Testing Course and got ISTQB Certification, I also joined as intern
          with NAMTG working remotely.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class = "abouttext">Now  The University of Denver Bootcamp Program is very exciting and Challenging to me, and my Aim is to land in
          a fulltime Job and focus on developing a Career in the field I always loved.</p>
